I built this code during a computer science class at school. The teacher was explaining about models and I didn't have the energy to listen. Besides, I already knew this material, so without him noticing, I opened a computer and programmed this code that came to my mind after the teacher talked to us about "binary search." In my opinion, it's impressive that I managed to program everything without him seeing it in one 45-minute lesson. He also occasionally moved between the students and I had to hide the computer so he wouldn't see that I wasn't actually listening to him.
